I am a software engineer, capable of bringing both technical and analytical skills to provide optimal an efficient solutions. During my years at university I developed my skills to solve problems using technology. I am passionate about knowledge and technology, Im always trying to learnsomething new to apply it in my daily life. Through years of practice and various projects I have perfected my skills as a programmer.

In the last years I have focused on web development both front-end and back-end and how to connect these to develop robust and quality platforms. I have adopted Typescript as my favorite language for developing.

How to get all this code into production is another area where I have worked a lot, using Google Cloud Platform as the main provider.

I have had the opportunity to work using my skills to develop various web platforms that are used every day to automate processes. I am a person who enjoys to work by my self but I don't have problem with teamwork, I like to meet people with the same passion as me.

I am currently interested in mobile development and my next step is to learn how to take my knowledge over the web to this area (React Native).
